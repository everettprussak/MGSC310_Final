# Notes
The Confusion Matrix in FinalProjectProposal.html for Model 1 (Basic Logistic Regression) is printed wrong. The results would be different in our personal computers, but once the file would get knitted it would get the original confusion plot we made. That means that 'Train Confusion Matrix' and 'Test Confusion Matrix' are not accurate, however the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity is correct and using the correct Confusion Matrix. We are not entirely sure why teh new confusoin matrix would not be updated but this does not affect the results in anyway.
